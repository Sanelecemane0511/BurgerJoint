Burger Joint Ordering System
Natively Compiled Applications and Logic Development

Project Description
This is a web application built using ASP.NET Core and C#. It is an ordering platform where users can customize and buy burgers. The project focuses on back-end logic, data security, and making sure the database updates correctly when a user makes an order.

Technical Skills Used
Back-end: C# and .NET Core.
Front-end: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Database: Microsoft SQL Server using Entity Framework Core.
Version Control: Git and GitHub.

Main Features
Object-Oriented Programming: I used C# classes to manage burger items and calculate prices automatically.
Database Integration: The system saves user information and order history into a SQL database.
Responsive Design: The website works on both computers and mobile phones.

Technical Challenge Solved
While building this project, I found a problem where the custom burgers created by users were not saving to the database correctly. I solved this by fixing the data-binding logic. This made sure that every time a user added an item to their cart, the system updated the database and showed the change on the screen immediately.
